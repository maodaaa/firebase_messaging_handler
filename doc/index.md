## Platform Support

| Platform | Push / FCM | Local display | Scheduling | Inbox / in-app | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Best-supported path for full end-to-end validation, including real FCM device tests. |
| iOS | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Requires APNs configuration in Apple Developer and Firebase. Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods are both supported. |
| Web | Yes | Browser notification only | No | Yes | Requires Firebase web config, a messaging service worker, secure context, notification permission, and `webVapidKey` when your Firebase project requires one. WASM analysis is supported. |
| macOS | Firebase-dependent | Yes | Yes | Yes | Validate token retrieval and foreground/background delivery on target hardware before shipping. |
| Windows | No FCM delivery | Local-notification surface where dependencies support it | Local-notification surface where dependencies support it | Yes | FCM is disabled gracefully; diagnostics explain the unsupported FCM path. |
| Linux | No FCM delivery | Local-notification surface where dependencies support it | Local-notification surface where dependencies support it | Yes | FCM is disabled gracefully; diagnostics explain the unsupported FCM path. |

## Recommended Setup Path

1. Install the package and initialize Firebase for your app.
2. Complete the platform setup guide for every target you ship.
3. Call `FirebaseMessagingHandler.instance.init(...)` once during app startup.
4. Subscribe to the returned click stream and wire your navigation handler.
5. Run `runDiagnostics()` on real devices before debugging backend payloads.
6. For release validation, run unit tests, publish dry-run, `pana`, and the example Android integration tests from the release checklist.

## Package Positioning

This package focuses on the practical gaps teams hit with raw `firebase_messaging`:

- foreground, background, and terminated click handling in one flow
- data-only payload promotion into local notifications
- in-app presentation and inbox storage
- diagnostics that surface real setup failures
- incremental adoption instead of all-or-nothing migration
